A design system for everyone.

## Pattern-first

Teams spend a lot of time on enhancing the end user experience. We encapsulate many of the common web design best practices and make them easy to use with our patterns. Allowing both design and development teams to focus on delivering the product.


## Framework-agnostic

Have multiple front-end stack in your organisation and need a consistent look and feel? Go UI utilise modern browser features such as Web Components and CSS custom properties so that the components and patterns can be used in any JavaScript framework, or no framework at all.

## Adaptable

Go UI makes it easy for developers to build adaptive web applications, this means out-of-the-box, your application support dark mode and reduced motion preferences from the user's operating system.



## Accessibility

Accessibility (a11y) is one of the most important criteria that enterprise web applications need to pay attention to. We hope to address this by providing accessible patterns and components that developers can take and reuse. Here are the things we do to ensure a high quality of a11y from the Go UI library.

- Automated a11y testing for each component.
- Use semantic HTML elements under the hood.
- Reference w3.org guidelines wherever possible.
- By the nature of open-source, we encourage a11y experts in the community to test our system and [provide feedbacks](https://github.com/go-components/go-components/issues/new?assignees=&labels=a11y%2C+bug&template=a11y-issue.md&title=%5BA11y+BUG%5D).
