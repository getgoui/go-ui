# Contributing guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Write commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification

To help humans and machines know what changed in each commit, we write commits in the following format.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. **fix**: a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [PATCH](https://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
2. **feat**: a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
3. **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [MAJOR](https://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
4. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:`

| Commit Type | Title                    | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`      | Features                 | A new feature                                                                                               |
| `fix`       | Bug Fixes                | A bug Fix                                                                                                   |
| `docs`      | Documentation            | Documentation only changes                                                                                  |
| `style`     | Styles                   | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)      |
| `refactor`  | Code Refactoring         | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                                   |
| `perf`      | Performance Improvements | A code change that improves performance                                                                     |
| `test`      | Tests                    | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                           |
| `build`     | Builds                   | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)         |
| `ci`        | Continuous Integrations  | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |
| `chore`     | Chores                   | Other changes that don't modify src or test files                                                           |
| `revert`    | Reverts                  | Reverts a previous commit                                                                                   |

5. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).
