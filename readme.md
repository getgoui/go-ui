## Pattern-first

Pattern first approach allows us to focus on what benefits our users, the developers, the most. We hope to provide you with standards-compliant and end-user-friendly patterns with rationales to save you from debating over common patterns over and over. Instead, your team can focus on the delivery of real features that benefits the end users.
