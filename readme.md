# Gov components
A design system that focuses on:
- Patterns
- Flexibility (framework agnostic)
- A11y


## Pattern-first

Pattern first approach allows us to focus on what benefits our users, the developers, the most. We hope to provide you with standards-compliant and end-user-friendly patterns with rationales to save you from debating over common patterns over and over. Instead, your team can focus on the delivery of real features that benefits the end users. 

## Flexibility
...
### Framework-agnostic

### Component usage

Components are built to be tree-shakeable so your app is not bloated with unused code.


## A11y

Accessibility (a11y) is one of the most important criteria that enterprise web applications need to pay attention to. We hope to address this by providing accessible patterns and components that developers can take and reuse. Here are the things we do to ensure a11y of our design system.

- Automated a11y testing for each component.
- Use semantic HTML elements under the hood.
- Build and reference w3.org a11y guidelines wherever possible.
- By the nature of open-source, we encourage a11y experts in the community to test our system and [provide feedbacks](https://github.com/gov-components/gov-components/issues/new?assignees=&labels=a11y%2C+bug&template=a11y-issue.md&title=%5BA11y+BUG%5D).
