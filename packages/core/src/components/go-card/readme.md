## Card links

Often with cards you want to allow users to click a link to another page to find out more information. `go-card` allows you to create accessible link cards with ease.

Similar to [`go-link`](./go-link) component, you can add a `href` attribute and turn the card into a link. The whole card will be clickable for ease of use and only the title part will be announced as a link for screen readers.
