# Table of contents <span class="text-size-0">`go-toc`</span>

<!-- Description -->

<div class="text-size-1">
  Table of contents (or in page navigation) is a component that sits on top of the content area and helps users to jump to specific section in the content area quickly.
</div>

## When to use

- Use at the start of main content area so users can quickly glance the information available on the page.

## Accessibility

- Semantic `nav` landmark is used to indicate the table of contents.
- `aria-labelledby` with id of the label element, this way screen readers will not announce the word "heading", which might confuse users.
- Linked elements will receive focus upon table of content item selection.
