# Dropdown <span class="text-size-0">`go-dropdown`</span>

<!-- Description -->

<div class="text-size-1">Dropdown is a lower-level component that serves as a wrapper for presenting a popup widget in-place of the interaction.</div>

## Usage


The main purpose of using the `go-dropdown` component is to solve these problems:
1. open dropdown panel in place of interaction
2. focus on first focusable element inside dropdown
3. trap focus inside dropdown

A `go-dropdown` can be used in a few different scenarios:

- Menus - display a list of choices inside the popup
- Select/combobox - form elements that allow users to select an option from a list.


## Accessibility

- The trigger element will have `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded` attributes automatically applied.
-
