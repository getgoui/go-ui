<!-- Description -->

<div class="text-size-1">
  Datepicker is a widget that enables users to select a date from a calendar display.
</div>

Datepickers are commonly used in forms that require users to select a date for a reservation, appointment, or event. They provide an intuitive and standardised way for users to input date information and prevent errors and confusion that can arise from manual entry.
