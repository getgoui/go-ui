# Callout section

<!-- Description -->

The callout pattern is a widely used design approach to prompting user engagement. This pattern is composed of two main components: a media section and a text section. Within the text section, there are three elements: a heading, an optional description, and an optional actions area that contains call-to-action (CTA) buttons.

The image component of the callout pattern typically features an eye-catching graphic or photograph that immediately draws the user's attention while the text section serves to provide more context and information about the highlighted content. The heading is a concise, engaging phrase that encapsulates the main idea, while the optional description offers further details and explanation. The CTA buttons invite users to perform specific actions related to the featured content. 


## When to use

- Use a callout pattern when you want to draw attention to a specific piece of content on a webpage, such as a promotion, new product, or customer testimonial.
- Use a callout pattern when you want to encourage user engagement and prompt users to take a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase, or registering for an event.
