<!-- Description -->

According to the [DTA Branding guidelines](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/guides-and-tools/requirements-australian-government-websites/branding), _Australian Government services must use common branding on their websites and print publications_.

We encapsulate this into a simple yet flexible component to help you comply with it in both light and dark colour schemes.
