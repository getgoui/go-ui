# Components

Go UI components are compiled with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) and the end results are 100% native [Web Components](../../docs/guides/web-components.mdw) that can be used with in any tech stack.

[Our patterns](../patterns/introduction) are made up of these components and provide optimisation for better user experience and accessibility, if you haven't seen the component you are looking for, feel free to [submit a request](https://github.com/getgoui/go-ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=Component+request).
