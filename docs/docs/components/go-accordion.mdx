## Demo

### Single mode

By default only one `<go-accordion-item>` element inside a `<go-accordion>` can be expanded at any given time. When clicked on a different `<go-accordion-item>`, the active one will be collapsed and the clicked one will be expanded.

<Demo code={demoSingle} />

### Multiple mode

There are times when you need multiple items to be open at the same time. Just add `multiple` attribute to the `<go-accordion>` element.

<Demo code={demoMultiple} />

### Nested

Nested accordions are also possible, the components will figure out which `<go-accordion>` component is being interacted with.

<Demo code={nestedDemo} />

### Customisation

There are 2 slots you can use to customise each item. `slot="heading"` and `slot="arrow"`

<Demo code={nestedDemo} />
