# Icon <span className="text-size-0">`go-icon`</span>

<!-- Description -->

<div className="text-size-1">
  Icons serve multiple purposes in a UI, they can convey information (e.g. icon button, icon tab) or they can be used as a visual representation.
</div>

:::tip Icon font CSS

Before using the `go-icon` component, you need to have the icon font CSS available in your application.

**Go UI does not bundle any icon fonts**. This is to keep the bundle size small for cases when icons are not required.

This documentation site references the Material Icons (Filled) hosted via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons), which is the default icon set for `go-icon` component.

The demo contains example of how to include the icon font CSS in your application.

- **Decorative icons** are purely for visual purposes, they should not be announced by screen readers, `go-icon` will add `aria-hidden` attribute to the by default.

- **Semantic icons** are meant to convey information and should be announced by screen readers, provide a `label` attribute to the `go-icon` component and the appropriate aria attributes will be applied.
