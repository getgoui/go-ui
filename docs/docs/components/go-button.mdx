# Button <span className="text-size-0">`go-button`</span>

<!-- Description, a11y, when to use, caveats, etc -->

<div className="text-size-1">A button is a simple way to call on the attention of the user.</div>

## When to use

Use a button when you want to:

- Call on the userâ€™s attention.
- Provide a way to initiate an action or a navigation (see [buttons vs links](#buttons-vs-links)).
- Provide a command that the user can execute, such as saving data or submitting a form.

### Buttons vs links

For a comprehensive breakdown of buttons and links, see [A Complete Guide to Links and Buttons](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/) from CSS Tricks.
Buttons and links may feel similar but they serve different purposes and have different accessibility requirements.

> Buttons are used for actions that affect the website's front-end or back-end; links are used for navigation and actions that don't affect the website at all.
