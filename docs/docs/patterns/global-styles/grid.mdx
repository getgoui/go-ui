# Grid

<!-- Description -->

Go Components provides a 12-column grid system, functionally similar to the popular Bootstrap grid system, but with a few key differences:

- Out of the box, there are less breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop), you can add more breakpoints by overriding the `$breakpoints` variable. [See customise breakpoints](./media-queries).
- The media query modifiers are based on the device names you have in the `$breakpoints` varialbe. (e.g. `col-tablet-6`, `col-desktop-4`)
- `.container` widths are based on the `$breakpoints` variable.
- `.row` divs are not necessary.
