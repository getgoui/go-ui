# Grid

<!-- Description -->

Go Components provides a familar 12-column grid system, with a few key differences to simplify the usage:

- There are less breakpoints, `mobile` by default, then `tablet` and `desktop`, this covers most of the usecases, while keeping your layouts flexible and performant. You can add more breakpoints by overriding the `$breakpoints` sass variable. [See how to override sass variables](../../guides/theming/sass#overriding-sass-variables).
- The media query modifiers are based on the device names you have in the `$breakpoints` varialbe. (e.g. `col-tablet-6`, `col-desktop-4`)
- There is no default gap between columns, you can add it by changing the `--go-grid-gap` css variable.
- `--go-outer-gutter` is applied as paddings of the grid container.
