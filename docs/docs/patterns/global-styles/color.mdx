# Color

We found that the most common colors used in the web can be categorised in these groups:

- Layout colors (e.g. background, text, border)
- Interactive colors (e.g. primary & secondary)
- Signal colors (e.g. success, error)
- Neutral colors (e.g. grey, black, white)
- Lightest and darkest colors (e.g. white, black)

## Tokens

Color tokens are used to define colors in the theme. We use CSS variables to define the colors in their rgb values so they can be customised easily by the consumer apps.

@todo list color tokens here.

## Theming

Go components use CSS variables to define their colors, each component has a set of variables that can be overridden.
