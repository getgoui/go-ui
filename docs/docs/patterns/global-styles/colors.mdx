# Colors

We found that the most common colors used in the web can be categorised in these groups:

- Layout colors (e.g. background, text, border)
- Interactive colors (e.g. primary & secondary)
- Signal colors (e.g. success, error)
- Neutral colors (e.g. greys)
- Lightest and darkest colors (e.g. white, black)

## Tokens

Color tokens are used to define colors in the theme. We use CSS variables to define the colors in their rgb values so they can be customised easily by the consumer apps.

### Dark theme

One advantage of using color tokens is that if we need dark theme, we can just reverse the usage of the color tokens.
When light theme (default) is used, 100 means lightest shade of this color, while 900 means darkest shade; in dark theme the opposite is true.

:::tip
Use the theme switcher in demo "browser" to toggle between light and dark theme and see how the components change.
