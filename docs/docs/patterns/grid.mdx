# Grid

<!-- Description -->

Go Components provides a 12-column grid system, functionally similar to the popular Bootstrap grid system, but with a few key differences:

- Out of the box, there are less breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop), you can add more breakpoints by overriding the `$breakpoints` variable. [See customise breakpoints](#customise-breakpoints).
- The media query modifiers are based on the device names you have in the `$breakpoints` varialbe. (e.g. `col-tablet-6`, `col-desktop-4`)
- `.container` widths are based on the `$breakpoints` variable.
- `.row` divs are not necessary.

<!-- Demos, tips, variations, use cases -->

## Example

<Demo code={demoSource} />

## Customise breakpoints

You can customise breakpoints by importing the source scss file and overriding the `$breakpoints` variable.

```scss
// your/project/path/to/style.scss
@import grid from '~/go-components/src/global/scss/grid.scss

$breakpoints = (
  mobile: 320px,
  phablet: 540px,
  tablet: 768px,
  desktop: 1024px,
  ultrawide: 1400px,
)
```
