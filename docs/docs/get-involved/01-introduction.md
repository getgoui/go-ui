## Why? 


## How?

There are many ways to contribute to this project. You can help us via:

- Review documentations
  - If you see any issue on this site, simply click the `Edit this page` link down at the bottom and make a pull request.
- Review accessibility issues
  - Although we use automated tests for picking up obvious a11y issues, it's not the same as using them in real life. If you have experience using assistive technologies, we'd love for you to let us know if any of our components/patterns have accessibility issues by [creating a Github issue](https://github.com/go-components/go-components/issues/new?assignees=&labels=a11y%2C+bug&template=a11y-issue.md&title=%5BA11y+BUG%5D).
- Code contribution
  - We spent significant efforts to make the development experience streamlined. See our [development guide](./development-guide) for more details.
