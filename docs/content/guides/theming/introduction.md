# Theming

There are 2 ways of customising your stylesheet for Go Components. 

## Overriding variables

We use both [Sass variables](./sass) and [CSS variables](./css-variables) in our design system to strive to optimal balance between functionality, flexibility and maintainability.

## Writing your own CSS

This is sometimes necessary as the design system's job is to provide a good springboard for your team to achieve consistency with less effort.

However there will be cases when design team needs to flex their creative muscles and come up with the *wow* factor for your site. We'll leave this part to you as it becomes mainly a communication task between your design and development teams.
