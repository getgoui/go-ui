# Framework integration

Although it is fully functional with the `@go-ui/core` package using just web component compatibility, our framework wrappers provide an easier way for your preferred framework to interact with Go UI.

Currently we have the following packages:

- [React](integration/react) | [@go-ui/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go-ui/react) 
- [Vue (v3)](integration/vue) | [@go-ui/vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go-ui/vue)
