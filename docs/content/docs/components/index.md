# Components

Go UI components are compiled with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) and the end results are 100% native [Web Components](/guides/web-components) that can be used with in any tech stack.

[Our patterns](/docs/patterns) are made up of these components and they include some opinionated optimisations for user experience and accessibility.

If you can't find the component you are looking for, feel free to [submit a request](https://github.com/getgoui/go-ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=Component+request).
