# Patterns

Patterns are made up of [components](/docs/components) and they include some opinionated optimisations for user experience and accessibility.

A good way to think about patterns is that they solve 80% of the UI problems with 20% of the efforts, so using patterns, development teams can move very quickly and focus on more business-critical problems.
