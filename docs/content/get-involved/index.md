# Get involved

The goal of this project is to make it easier to develop accessible products with a good user experience. In order to achieve this goal, the project needs input and support from the web community, this includes developers, designers, content creators and business owners.

## Why

Getting involved helps the community to build better products and services for the general public, and depending on your role, you also get these benefits:
### as a developer

- Work with great tools like ([Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)). Read more about the [developer experience](./development-guide).
- Learn how to build components that can be [used everywhere](../guides/web-components) by everyone.
- Get recognised as an awesome OSS contributor (see [Contributors section](https://github.com/getgoui/go-ui#contributors-) on our GitHub page)
- Spend less time repeating the same implementation

### as a designer

- Improve accessibility for many projects and their users.
- Show case your experience and expertise.
- Learn more about accessibility and coding practices.

### as a business

- Supporting open source software projects can greatly improve the reputation of your brand in the developer community, which will in turn help your resourcing and hiring.
- [Get in touch](#get-in-touch) to see more ways GO UI can help your project.

### Review documentations

### Review accessibility issues

Although we use automated tests for picking up obvious a11y issues, it's not the same as using them in real life. If you have experience using assistive technologies, we'd love for you to let us know if any of our components/patterns have accessibility issues by [creating a Github issue](https://github.com/go-components/go-components/issues/new?assignees=&labels=a11y%2C+bug&template=a11y-issue.md&title=%5BA11y+BUG%5D).

### Code contribution
We spent significant efforts to make the development experience streamlined. See our [development guide](./development-guide) for more details.
